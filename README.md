# My First Multipage Project
* Objective - To implement a multipage web project.
    * Each web-page should showcase a different skill or feature of HTML / CSS
* Purpose - To recap on learned material

## Part 1 - Clone the project
* Begin by cloning this project into the `~/dev` directory.
* Open the newly cloned project in a code editor (Visual Studio Code, for example).

## Part 2 - Demonstrate Feature Familiarity
* Each `.html` file in this project has a title which describes the intended feature to be implemented.
    * `my-definition-list.html` file should have a [definition list]() using the `<dl></dl>` tags
    * `my-ordered-list.html` file should have an [ordered list]() using the `<ol></ol>` tags
    * `my-unordered-list.html` file should have an [unordered list]() using the `<ul></ul>` tags
    * `my-column-of-rows.html` file should have a [table of columns of several rows]() using the `<table><td><tr></tr></td></table>` tags
    * `my-row-of-columns.html` file should have a [table of rows of several columns]() using the `<table><tr><td></td></tr></table>` tags

## Part 3 - Creating navigation
* Ensure that there is a _navigation path_ that makes it possible to view each of the pages.
    * A _navigation path_ is a set of links from one web page to another that allows internet users to _navigate_ through the web.

## Part 3 - Rename files
* Rename each of the files to better match the content of the actual page.
    * For example, if `my-row-of-columns.html` contains several columns of bunny-images, rename `my-row-of-columns.html` to `bunny-images.html`.

## Part 4 - Refactor Navigation Paths
* Because each of the file names have been changed, create a

## Part 5 - Stylize your WebPage
* Modify the `style.css` file to ensure that each web page has a _cool style_.
